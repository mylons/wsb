I just dont see it falling below 15, too many people regret buying it below 15 for it slip below that price line for long, yet even a year. \n\nI mean theres crazier investments. But you could theoretically do this same trade with SPX. Debit spreads are good to leverage smaller moves. You can turn a stocks 5%+ movement into a 150% return, when a leap would maybe of broke even or net you a 25%+ return. \n\nThe inverse could happen, i had a PLTR leap 6x in 4 weeks, where if i had these spreads it would've moved 15% because of the IV. Debit spreads dont truly become realized until being insanely deep ITM, in low IV, or near expiration. The issue is liquidity if its deep ITM, so you'll have to give some up to sell. but PLTR is such a meme and probably going to be the next tesla in terms of people yoloing in it, i dont see liquidity going away.\n\nAlso look at AMD, a similar meme stock that boomed this year, look at the option chains liquidity regarding deep ITM calls. Not the best, but its still there. if you had deep ITM leap spreads you opened on AMD at 50-60, you'd be able to sell for 90% of the spreads value. 90% of 2.5x is still a pretty good trade for a bet of \"underlying X will stay above Y by Z date\" which ive set at 15, for PLTR on jan 21 2022", "Very valid points.

Never ever FOMO. It always end bad\n2. Buy new innovative companies shares before others\n3. When stocks go up then check the market and take pleasure. When they go down then keep the phone aside. \n4. Dont use leverage. If you use leverage and make profits then inmediately use those profits to buy more shares of something which is undervalued.\n5. Dont diversify too much. Diversification protects wealth for someone who doesnt know what they are buying. Concentrate something you know is a great deal\n6. Market cap is very very important. Always look at that. But also what's important is total addressable market of that sector\n7. Meme stocks are not bad. They can make you rich. Trick for finding best meme stock is to see who are the people behind that stock.\n8. To get rich you will have to hold some Investments for the long term. You can only hold something long term when you have patience and when you are not over leveraged and when you dont get emotional seeing charts\n9. Buy when there is a rumor, not when there is a news\n10. Dont sell unless something fundamentally changed.

First of all, this is just a LETTER OF INTENT, not a definitive agreement, so it's not a done deal. Secondly, there is a shareholder meeting on December 3rd to try and extend the date by which THCB has to consummate a business combination - from Dec 7th to April 30, 2021. At that meeting, shareholders will have the right to redeem shares - which means there's a chance a significant portion of the trust could be returned to shareholders - leaving little left for the merger. It is also worth noting that the structure of this SPAC is very dilutive - 1 warrant for every share of publicly traded commons. So if half the holders redeem, that would me 2 warrants for every share of commons. And that doesn't even include the founders shares or the warrants the sponsor owns. \n\nIt is also possible that THCB may add money to the trust to entice shareholders not to redeem which would put the game into overtime.\n\nBottom line, this is sort of a crummy structure and only just a letter of intent, which is not binding. I suspect the battery company will wait and see if THCB can get the extension and see how many holders redeem their commons.

Recently, Cohen (founder of CHWY) got in a 10% stake and is looking to change the company\u2019s position in the market, focus on e-commerce, etc. do basically what CHWY did but for gaming.

In either case, share price will go up but with the tender offer and buyout, that\u2019s when shorts are utterly fucked. However when it will exactly happen is hard to say.

You get taxed a lot less for gains from a position you held onto for over a year. A lot of big investors bought in when SPY was around 250 back in April/May and have already made a lot of money. If they sell now, the gains would be a lot smaller compared to if they sell it in April/May, so they're holding it hoping the stock market doesn't go down too much in the next 5 months. Once we hit the spring, people are going to be a lot more likely to sell if there's bad news than they are right now to lock in their gains.\n\nI wouldn't recommend buying puts in specific companies though as investors probably won't sell all of their positions.
